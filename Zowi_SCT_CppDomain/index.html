    <h1>YAKINDU Zowi C++ domain pro example</h1>
    <p class="pro-feature">
      This is a example for the C++ integration of YAKINDU statechart tools.
      The code can be used on the Zowi roboter developed by BQ.

    </p>
    <h2> The statechart </h2>
    <p> The statechart is quiet simple. Zowi is awake for 30 s and walking forward. 
    Zowi will avoid Obstacles if he founds them and turns left. 
    He can return from sleeping mode if any noise occurs. </p>
    <p> Within the definition section a zowi variable is declared, which is referenced by the Zowi class. With this, it is possible to use the Zowi class within the statechart. </p>

    <h2>Libraries and manually written code</h2>
    <p>The required Zowi projects were added to the Zowi folder. Additionally, C++ timer were added to the src folder.</p>
    <h2>Set up your system</h2>
    <p>For compiling and flashing the Eclipse C++ IDE for Arduino was used. 
    Installing instructions and further informations can be found here(https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-c-ide-arduino). Additonally, ensure that you got an Arduino IDE installed</p>
    <p>The plugin can easily be added over Help->Install New Software.. Therefore, 
    the current update site is needed (Oxygen: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/9.3)</p>
    <h2>Set up the project</h2>
    <p>It's necessary to install an Arduino IDE and download the required libararies:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on 'Help'</li>
      <li>Open the 'Arduino Downloads Manager'</li>
      <li>Add 'Arduino AVR platforms' within the 'Platforms' tab</li>
      <li>Add 'Servo' within the 'Libraries' tab</li>
      <li>After this open the project preferences</li>
      <li>Open Libraries and add the required Libraries (Device Control - Servo; Platform Libraries - Arduino AVR Boards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>... and your project should be ready to build.</p>
