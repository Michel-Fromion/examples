    <h1>Digital Watch</h1>
	<p>The digital watch example is based on a statechart created by David Harel in "On Visual Formalisms", in Communications of the ACM, May 1998. It is a good example for advanced statecharts,
	makes use of History States, and can be used to showcase a feature of YAKINDU SCT - refactoring composite states into subdiagrams.</p>
	<p>The statechart in its original form is pretty huge, see the image below. It's rather hard to really see what is going on.</p>
	<img class="standard-image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="First form" src="images/Watch.png" />
	<p>After refactoring, the whole situation is much better - two composite states have been refactored into subdiagrams and can be seen in a separate editor.
	<img class="standard-image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="Second form after refactoring" src="images/watch_subdiagrams.png" />
	The subdiagram:
