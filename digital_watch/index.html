    <h1>Digital Watch</h1>
	<p>This digital watch was first designed by Harel, the founder of the Statecharts Theory. He described it in "On Visual Formalisms", published in "Communications of the ACM" in May 1988.</p>
	<p>As you can see in the picture below, the complete statechart is rather complicated and not easy to completely grasp on first glance.

	<p>We can use one of YAKINDU SCT's features, extracting composite states into subdiagrams!
	<img class="standard-image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="Abstracted statechart using subdiagrams" src="images/Watch_subdiagrams.png" /></p>
	<p>This allows you to abstract the statechart to any level you want, so that you can review the statechart's overall functionality and its inner workings separately - much like a class diagram versus the complete codebase.
	Copy the example to your workspace and try the subdiagram editor!</p>
	<p>For reference, the interface declaration of both statecharts:
