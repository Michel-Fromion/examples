    <h1>Digital Watch</h1>
	<p>The digital watch example is based on a statechart created by David Harel in "On Visual Formalisms", in Communications of the ACM, May 1998. It is a good example for advanced statecharts,
	makes use of History States, and can be used to showcase a feature of YAKINDU SCT - refactoring composite states into subdiagrams.</p>
	<p>The statechart in its original form is pretty huge, see the image below. It's rather hard to really see what is going on.</p>

	<p>After refactoring, the whole situation is much better - two composite states have been refactored into subdiagrams and can be seen in a separate editor.

=======
	<p>This digital watch was first designed by Harel, the founder of the Statecharts Theory. He described it in "On Visual Formalisms", published in "Communications of the ACM" in May 1988.</p>
	<p>As you can see in the picture below, the complete statechart is rather complicated and not easy to completely grasp on first glance.
	<img class="standard-image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="First version of the statechart" src="images/Watch.png" /></p>
	<p>We can use one of YAKINDU SCT's features, extracting composite states into subdiagrams!
	<img class="standard-image" style="border-width: 0px;" alt="Abstracted statechart using subdiagrams" src="images/Watch_subdiagrams.png" /></p>
	<p>This allows you to abstract the statechart to any level you want, so that you can review the statechart's overall functionality and its inner workings separately - much like a class diagram versus the complete codebase.
	Copy the example to your workspace and try the subdiagram editor!</p>
	<p>For reference, the interface declaration of both statecharts:
