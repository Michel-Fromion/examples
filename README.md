# Welcome to the YAKINDU Statechart Tools Examples Repository!

This repository is hosting sample state machine models, code, instructions etc. for **YAKINDU Statechart Tools**, a tool suite to create and simulate state machines. Additionally, you use YAKINDU Statechart Tools to turn your state machines into source code of several programming languages.

Using the **Example Wizard**, which is available in YAKINDU Statechart Tools since release 2.7, you can clone this repository to your local disk and explore the examples.

If you think you have a good example as well, feel free to submit is by creating a pull request! Your contributions are very much appreciated!
