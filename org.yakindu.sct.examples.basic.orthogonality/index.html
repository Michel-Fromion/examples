    <h1>Orthogonality</h1>

    <p>This example demonstrates the usage of orthogonal states as well as of forking and joining synchronization nodes.</p>

    <h2>Orthogonal states</h2>
<p>
An <strong>orthogonal state</strong> is basically a composite state with more than one region. These regions are executed virtually concurrently. 
	<strong>Please note</strong> the word 
	<em>virtually</em>! YAKINDU Statechart Tools does not guarantee in any way that orthogonal regions are 
	<em>really</em> executed concurrently. At the moment, no code generator utilizes threads to achieve this. Orthogonal states should rather be understood as a manner to have two or more sub-statecharts working together, however, they are executed 
	<em>one after the other</em> in every run-to-completion cycle, and in a defined order: top to bottom, left to right. The same applies to multiple regions in the statechart itself. Please consult section 
	<a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/sclang_reactions#sclang_raising_and_processing_an_event">&quot;Raising and processing an event&quot;</a> for further information on region priorities and their meanings for the statechart execution.
</p>
    
    <h2>Synchronizations</h2>
<p>
A <strong>synchronization</strong> is a means to either split a flow into several parallel regions of a substate or to join several parallel flows from orthogonal regions into a single flow.
</p>
<p>
The synchronization state corresponds to the UML&#8217;s concepts of fork and join. Whether a synchronization state behaves as a fork or as a join depends on its usage.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A synchronization with a single incoming transition and several outgoing ones 
		<em>forks</em> the flow into several regions of the same substate. These regions are executed in parallel.
	</li>
	<li>A synchronization with several incoming transitions from parallel regions of the same substate and a single outgoing transition 
		<em>joins</em> the incoming flows into a single flow of execution.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
A synchronization state is shown as a thick horizontal or vertical line.
</p>
<p>
For a synchronization to actually join the incoming transitions and execute the outgoing one, all of the following conditions must be met:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>All source states of all transitions leading to the synchronization must be active.</li>
	<li>All guard conditions that are specified in all these transitions must be fulfilled.</li>
	<li>If one or more triggers are defined, at least one trigger must fire at a point in time while the conditions above are met.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example model shows a sample statechart containing a forking and a joining synchronization. After having left the 
	<strong>Initialize</strong> state, the synchronization state forks the execution flow into two regions 
	<em>r1</em> and 
	<em>r2</em>. Both are part of the 
	<strong>Process</strong> composite state and both are executed virtually concurrently. That is, when activating 
	<strong>Process</strong>, the substates 
	<strong>Line A 1</strong> and 
	<strong>Line B 1</strong> also become active. When the flows continues and both 
	<strong>Line A 2</strong> and 
	<strong>Line B 2</strong> have been reached, the synchronization state on the right-hand side joins the flows and transitions to substates 
	<strong>Cleanup</strong>, making it the active state. However, as long as only one of 
	<strong>Line A 2</strong> and 
	<strong>Line B 2</strong> is active, the synchronization will wait for the other one to also become active, before proceeding to 
	<strong>Cleanup</strong>.
