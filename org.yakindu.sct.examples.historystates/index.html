    <h1>History States</h1>

    <p>This example demonstrates the usage of history states. Different example models show the difference between shallow and deep history states.</p>


	<h3 id="sclang_shallow_history_states">Shallow history states</h3>
<p>A 
	<strong>shallow history state</strong> is a pseudo state that is placed inside the region of a composite state. It is used to remember the last active state inside a composite state. This makes it possible to jump back to the remembered state instead of starting at the inner initial state again.
</p>
<p>A history state saves the current state exactly when its containing region is left. A shallow history state saves the state of the current level only. If you need to save the status of multiple nested composite states, use a 
	<a href="sclang_graphical_elements#sclang_deep_history_states">deep history state</a>.
</p>
<p><div class="example"></p>
<p>The following example, showing the answering of a questionaire, explains this:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="Shallow history [1]" title="Shallow history [1]" border="0" src="http://info.itemis.com/hubfs/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/images/docu_shallow_history_init.png"/>
	<br/>
	<img alt="Shallow history [2]" title="Shallow history [2]" border="0" src="http://info.itemis.com/hubfs/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/images/docu_shallow_history_nextQuestion1.png"/>
	<br/>
	<img alt="Shallow history [3]" title="Shallow history [3]" border="0" src="http://info.itemis.com/hubfs/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/images/docu_shallow_history_nextQuestion2.png"/>
</p>
<p>Inside the 
	<strong>answeringQuestions</strong> composite state, it is always possible to send a 
	<em>pause</em> event, which will return to the 
	<strong>init</strong> state. At this point, the previous state, i.e., the last-answered question, is saved to the shallow history state.
</p>
<p>
	<img alt="Shallow history [4]" title="Shallow history [4]" border="0" src="http://info.itemis.com/hubfs/yakindu/statechart-tools/documentation/images/docu_shallow_history_pause.png"/>
</p>
<p>When the 
	<em>continue</em> event is triggered, the most recent active state inside of the composite state 
	<strong>answeringQuestions</strong> is activated again. The respondent doesn&#8217;t have to answer the previous questions again, he can simply resume.
</p>

<h3 id="sclang_deep_history_states">Deep history states</h3>
<p>A 
	<strong>deep history state</strong> is similar to a shallow history state, but more complex. With a deep history state, the latest status of multiple nested states is remembered.
</p>
<p>A history state saves the current state exactly when its containing region is left. A deep history state saves the status of multiple nested composite states. If saving the state of the current level only is sufficient, consider using a 
	<a href="sclang_graphical_elements#sclang_shallow_history_states">shallow history state</a> instead.
