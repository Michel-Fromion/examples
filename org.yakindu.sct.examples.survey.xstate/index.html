    <h2 id="1">Blinky Statechart Model</h2>

      <p>The behavior of Blinky is defined by a simple statechart that looks 
      as follows.</p>

    <h2 id="2">What RKH is?</h2>
    <p>
      RKH is a flexible, efficient, highly portable, and freely available 
      open-source state machine framework providing the infrastructure for 
      quickly and safely developing reactive applications for real-time 
      embedded systems.
    </p>
    <p><img class="standard-image" src="images/rkh-features.png" /></p>

    <p>
      RKH provides not only an unusual, efficient and straightforward method 
      for implementing and executing state machines, but also the needed 
      infrastructure to build reactive applications in embedded systems. It 
      is composed of modules, procedures, and supporting tools; such as a 
      method for implementing and executing flat state machines and 
      statecharts, asynchronous messaging, cross-platform abstraction, run 
      time tracing, time management, dynamic memory mechanism to deal with 
      fragmentation, unit-test harness, plus others.</p>
    <p>
      RKH allows developers to verify and validate a reactive application’s 
      behaviour at runtime by means of the framework’s built-in tracer. It 
      can utilize any traditional OS/RTOS or work without one. It also 
      encourages the embedded software community to apply best principles and 
      practices of software engineering for building flexible, maintainable 
      and reusable software.</p>
    <p>
      RKH is open source and licensed under the GNU v3.0. You can find the 
      <a href=https://github.com/vortexmakes/RKH>source code on GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>
      If you want to learn more about the benefits of this flexible, 
      efficient and highly portable state machine framework read on 
      <a href=https://blogs.itemis.com/en/rkh-state-machine-framework-for-reactive-and-real-time-embedded-systems>here</a>.

    <h2 id="3">Toolchain installation</h2>

      <h3>Install AC6 System Workbench for STM32 (SW4STM32)</h3>
      <p> The System Workbench toolchain, called SW4STM32, is a free multi-OS software development environment based on Eclipse, 
        which supports the full range of STM32 microcontrollers and associated boards.</p>

      <p><img class="large" src="images/SW4STM32.png" /></p>
      <p>Download Linux installer from here:
      <a href=http://www.ac6-tools.com/downloads/SW4STM32/install_sw4stm32_linux_64bits-v2.9.run>SW4STM32-V2.9-lnx64</a> </p>

      <h3>Install YAKINDU SCT Plugin </h3>
      <p>Go to Eclipse Marketplace and type yakindu in search box:</p>
      <p><img class="standard-image" src="images/yakindu-plugin.png" /></p>
    
      <p>Select and confirm all features</p>
      <p><img class="standard-image" src="images/yakindu-plugin-features.png" /></p>

      <h3>Install RKH code generator </h3>
      <p> 
        If code generation does not work and Yakindu shows error markers on the 
        model/Blinky.sgen file then you likely have to install the Yakindu RKH 
        code generator. This can be done in the example wizard or in the SGen wizard.
      <ol>
        <li>Open File > New > Code generator module</li>
        <li>Click on 'next'</li>
        <li>Choose a 'Generator' and click on 'Install more..'</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions and select the RKH Generator</li>
        <li>Finish and Restart.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
  
      <h3>Get RKH framework</h3>
      <p> 
      In order to build this example you have to download the RKH 
      framework and install the Trazer tool.
      RKH can be obtained from its official repository by using the following 
      Git commands:</p>
      <ol>
       <li><code>cd path/to/org.yakindu.sct.examples.rkh.blinky.stm32/</code></li>
       <li><code>git clone https://github.com/vortexmakes/RKH.git
       </code></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Install Trazer tool</h3>
      <p> 
      RKH allows developers to verify and validate a reactive application’s 
      behaviour at runtime by means of its built-in tracer. In addition, 
      RKH provides a very simple but powerful console application, called 
      Trazer, to visualize the trace events’ output in a legible manner. It 
      can be downloaded and installed as follows.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Download Trazer for Linux 64-bits from its 
          <a href=https://github.com/vortexmakes/Trazer/releases/download/3.2/RC_trazer_3_2_lnx64b.tar.gz>
          official repository</a></li>
      <li>Copy downloaded file to a folder and extract it</li>
      <li>Change the directory to previous folder</li>
      <li>Check it is alright by executing ./trazer</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Project structure</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>model</dt>
      <dd>contains Blinky state machine (<i>blinky.sct</i>) and generator model (<i>blinky.sgen</i>)</dd>
      <dt>src</dt>
      <dd>Includes both application code and BSP (Board Support Package) code. 
      The most important files and directories are listed below:</dd>
      <ul>
        <li><i>signals.h</i>: defines signals as enumerated constants, which 
        are used as state machine triggers.</li>
        <li><i>main.c</i>: contains the main() function, which initializes 
        both BSP and Blinky active object, then executes the RKH framework in 
        order to orchestrates this reactive application.</li>
        <li><i>rkhcfg.h</i>: adapts and configures RKH in compile time.</li>
        <li><i>bsp</i>: this folder contains the source code of BSP for STM32 bare metal 
        platform.  It handles interrupts, implements the communication with 
        Trazer tool and setups the RKH native non-preemptive cooperative scheduler for dispatch events.
        The hardware inicialization and peripherals access routines are autogenerated with STM32CubeMX 
        tool from STM32CubeMX.ioc file located in STM32CubeMX folder.
        In the Yakindu’s Standard Edition you cannot 
        include header files, but it is possible to create operations, in 
        which the platform specific C code can be called. Within these 
        operations we can call the specific code to interact with the 
        platform, which is located in this folder.</li>
      </ul>
      <dt>src-gen</dt>
      <dd>Includes the generated C code compatible with RKH 
      framework, which will be automatically be updated when you edit and 
      save the statechart.</dd>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Blinky.h/.c</i>: specifies and implements the state machine of 
        Blinky active object. Please correlate this implementation

    <h2 id="5">Runing on STM32F407F-DISC1 board </h2>

    <h3>Hardware Setup</h3>
    <p> The STM32F407G-DISC1 allows users to easily develop applications with 
        the STM32F407VG high performance microcontroller with the ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit core. 
        It includes everything required either for beginners or for experienced users to get quickly started.</p>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/stm32f407g-disc1.jpg" /></p>

    <p> The demo toggles the <b>LD5 (red)</b> to <b>on/off</b> according to <code>redOn()</code> / <code>redOff()</code> calls.
     For running the Blinky demo the default jumper configuration must be sets.  </p>

    <p> The BSP for Blinky Demo on STM32, allocate de RKH trace stream output on the <b>USART2</b> peripheral,
    available on <b>PA3</b> and <b>PA2</b> pins of <b>P1</b> connector. </p>

    <p> There are two ways to visualize RKH trace output with Trazer:</p>

    <li> Using an USART to USB dongle from the market connected for instance to STM32F407 <b>USART2</b> available on connector <b>P1 pin 14 (PA2: USART2_TX)</b> and <b>P1 pin 13 (PA3: USART2_RX)</b>. </li>
    <li> Using the ST-LINK/V2-A Virtual COM Port available on <b>CN1</b> from <b>U2 pin 12 (ST-LINK_TX)</b> and <b>U2 pin 13 (ST-LINK_RX)</b>.
        <br>These pins are not connected to the USART of the STM32F407 microcontroller but may be usables flywiring ST-LINK/V2-A virtual COM port 
        <b>(ST-LINK VCP on U2 pin 12 and 13)</b> to STM32F407 USART2 <b>(PA2 and PA3: P1 pin 14 and 13)</b> as shown in the Figure below: </li>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/disc1-flywires.png" /></p>
    
    <h3>Configure Trazer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect the board to host PC using an micro-usb cable.</li>
      <li>Identify Trazer COM Port <b>(e.g. /dev/ttyUSB#)</b> according to selection from setup stage.</li>
      <li><p>Open a console, change the directory where you previously 
          downloaded Trazer, and run it by executing the following command 
          line: </p>
            <code>./trazer -c /dev/ttyUSB# 115200 8n1</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Debuging</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on project <b>'org.yakindu.sct.examples.rkh.blinky.stm32'</b> in the Eclipse 'Project Explorer'</li>
      <li>Choose <b>'Debug As > Ac6 STM32 C/C++ Application'</b></li>
      <li>Create and/or Run the Default Debug Configuration for Ac6STM32 Debugging</li>
      <p><img class="standard-image" src="images/debug.png" /></p>
      <li>
      <p>The binary is downloaded to target board and the debugging perspective is shown.</p>
      <li>Press <b>'F8'</b> to run.</li>
      <p><img class="standard-image" src="images/blinky-debug.png" /></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Verify and validate</h3>
      <p>While the application is running, you can validate and verify its 
      behaviour through the trace events showed on the Trazer output. Each 
      trace event includes a time stamp and additional information associated 
      with it. A capture of Trazer output is shown below. It shows the trace 
      records when the state machine processes a <code>after 1 sec</code> 
      trigger. Since RKH can generate more than 100 different trace events 
      during its execution, its trace module allow you to filter one or more 
      of them in runtime, so you can choose the traces that you need.
