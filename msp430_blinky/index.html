    <h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>
	
	<p>
	The example includes three states - Initialization, redOn and redOff.
	In this pro example the header file of the MSP430G2553 is included,
	so that it is possible to access and manipulate the registers of the MPS430 directly in Statechart Tools.

    <h2>Using another Launchpad </h2>

    <p>If you want to run the Example on another Launchpad you have to do only some changes. 
	For example for the MSP430FR5969 - At first replace the MSP430G2533 header by the MSP430GFR5969 header file.
	Change the import of the MSP430 in the Statechart Tool. Now you can adapt the WDT and LED Ports.</p>
