    <h1>Arduino - Integration Guide using freeRTOS with polling (C)</h1>

<p>
	Embedded Systems Integration Guide for Arduino with @CycleBased or @EventDriven execution using freeRTOS with polling.
    </p>
    <p>
    This example has been created to illustrate how an Arduino can be programmed using CycleBased or EventDriven execution and freeRTOS.
    You can find a detailed description in our <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/embedded_systems_integration_guide">documentation</a>.
    </p>
	<h2> The state machine </h2>
	<p>
	The state machine contains the following parts:
	<ul>
	<li>Two states</li>
	<li>One final state</li>
	<li>Two in events</li>
	<li>Two out events</li>
	<li>One timed event</li>
	</ul>
	The main idea is to use every component, 
	which got an effect on the integration of the state machine.
	A detailed description can be found in our <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/embedded_systems_integration_guide">documentation</a>.

      <h2>Installing the Arduino plugin</h2>
      <p>
		To compile the generated C code for Arduino, you should install an
        Eclipse plugin that can handle this and provides the needed libraries.
      	This example uses the Sloeber plugin. 
       </p>
       <p> 
       	The easiest way to install the plugin is using the example wizard.the
    	Select this example, click on 'Install Dependencies...' and follow the instructions.
        Your IDE may restart. SCT will restart and download the necessary Arduino libraries for you.
		Ensure that the installation has been completed before taking the next steps.
		You'll get a hint of the installation progress on the bottom right of your IDE.
       </p>
        	Another way is using the update side, which can be found at <a 
        	href="http://eclipse.baeyens.it/">http://eclipse.baeyens.it/</a>. In
        	YAKINDU Statechart Tools, simply install it by selecting <em>Help â†’ Install New
        	Software</em> in the main menu, typing or pasting
        	<code>http://eclipse.baeyens.it/update/V4/stable</code>
        	into the proper field, and follow the regular procedure.
        </p>
		<h2>Setup the example</h2>
		After the installation the example will not compile, as no port and board has been selected.
		Right click the project, open the 'Properties' page and open the Arduino tab. 
		As there was no platform selected before and the platform file was missing, an error will occur.
		Just click on 'Ok'. Select the platform folder, choose the board and select your port. That's it.
		The project is ready to compile and flash.
