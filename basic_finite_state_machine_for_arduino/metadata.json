	"description": "A very basic state machine example for the Arduino platform that switches an LED on and off. This example was used in an article on the website <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/\">instructables.com</a>. You can read the article <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/Finite-State-Machine-on-an-Arduino/\">here</a>. It demonstrates how to get started with YAKINDU Statechart Tools and the Arduino platform and contains a timer service for the Arduino. You need to have an Arduino plugin, as described in the example \"Arduino traffic light\" and in the linked article.",
